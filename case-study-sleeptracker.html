        <h3>Logging Sleep</h3>
        <div class="body-text">
            <p>Keeping in mind that we needed to keep track of different dates and times on the backend, 
                I wanted to limit the chance of user error as much as possible. Instead of requiring the 
                user to input their own text—which can lead to typos or differences in format— we used date 
                and time pickers, ensuring a proper format.</p>

            <img src="Media/Sleep Tracker/dateTime.gif"
            alt="Animation showing the use of date time buttons to select when a user woke up and went to sleep.">

            <p>This not only helps the user understand what is being asked of them, but helps the organization of 
                data on the backend.</p>

        <h3>Logging Sleepiness</h3>
        <div class="body-text">
            <p>I wanted to ensure that users could see at a glance what they were rating, so I created two 
                different icons: one that represented feeling awake and another to represent feeling sleepy. 
                I then utilized a range slider so users could easily pick how they were feeling.</p>

            <img src="Media/Sleep Tracker/sliderRange.gif"
            alt="Animation showing the use of a slider tool, ranging from awake to super sleepy.">

            <p>My partner and I felt this was the best way forward as it gave them a visual of their feeling, 
                rather than just providing them a numbered scale from 1 to 7.</p>

        <h3>Viewing the Data</h3>

            <img class="goal" src="Media/Sleep Tracker/sleepGoal.svg"
            alt="The main goal here is to make viewing sleep user friendly and intuitive.">

            <p>I wanted this app to be as user friendly and intuitive as possible. To do this, I decided 
                that we should have a useful initial view. This would allow users to log and view their 
                sleep straight from the home screen. Thus, immediately after logging their sleep, they are 
                able to see it.</p>

            alt="The main goal here is to minimize the clutter of viewing sleepiness.">

            <p>I did not want to overwhelm the user with information every time they try to view 
                their sleep and sleepiness history. So as to not bombard the user with a lot of 
                information, users are given a quick overview. There they can see their time slept 
                and their average logged sleepiness for that day.</p>

                log of their sleep and sleepiness.</p>

        <h2 class="image-text-moon">Challenges & Adapting</h2>
        <div class="body-text">
            <p>Initially, I had many big ideas, which I had created lo-fi and hi-fi mockups for.</p>

            <img class="large" src="Media/Sleep Tracker/Initial.png"
            alt="High fidelity mockups of initial screen designs: including splash page, log-in, 
            landing page, statistics, and history.">

            <p>But as we moved forward in the project, my partner and I realized that we would not 
                have time to implement everything. So, we had to scrap a few ideas and stick to the 
                essence of the project: logging and viewing sleep and sleepiness data.</p>

            <img class="extra-large" src="Media/Sleep Tracker/Used.png"
            alt="High fidelity mockups of the home and sleep history page.">

            <p>We ended up relying on these 4 screens to guide the code for our project.</p>

            <p>We also had to remove the editing option for sleep and sleepiness data. Instead, 
                we pivoted to focusing on error prevention by including a pop-up modal where the 
                user could ensure they wanted to follow through with their action.</p>

        <div class="body-text">
            <p>If I continued this project, I would love to include more features that could improve 
                its user experience.</p>
            
            <p>Specifically, I would like to:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Revisit my initial designs</li>
                <li>Test prototypes with prospective users (not just friends and family)</li>
                <li>Allow the user to edit their sleep & sleepiness data</li>
                <li>Add profile features</li>
                <li>Allow users to mark their sleep goals so they can know how often they’ve met their goals</li>

     <section>
        <h2 class="image-text-moon">Reflection & Takeaways</h2>
        <div class="body-text">
            <p>This project reminded me that it is important to stay focused on the essence of a project, 
                especially when given a short timeline. In this case specifically we had to focus on the minimum 
                viable product.</p>

            <p>There is a balance that needs to be maintained, where the key essence of the product is 
                delivered while also ensuring that it stands out amongst competitors and is intuitive and 
                enjoyable to use.</p>

            <p>Overall, it is important to stay creative, yet pragmatic about what is accomplishable 
                within a certain timeframe.</p>
