        <h3>Understanding Caregivers</h3>
            <div class="body-text">
                <p>Parents and caregivers are essential. They are saddled with many responsibilities and 
                    it is important that we come up with ways to support them. Even our own team member had a child
                    at the beginning of our project. After learning of his struggles and many responsibilities, 
                    we wanted to make an app that would be able to help him and others like him out.</p>
                  
                <p>To figure out their needs and pain points, we did some initial research to figure out 
                    what the current state of the world is for people who care for newborns. Our key insights 
                    were that:</p>

                <img class="large" src="Media/BabySteps/quotes.svg"
                    alt="caregivers find leaving the hospital scary, and 48% of them feel unsupported in times of stress.">

                <p>A lack of support is exacerbated especially when leaving the hospital. Parents go from 
                    having the support of nurses, to being on their own. This can be very daunting, especially 
                    for first-time parents.</p>
                  
                <p>With information on the current state of the world and to guide our further steps, our team 
                    created an initial problem statement:</p>
          
                <p class="problem-statement">Parents with newborns need to know what their baby’s needs are and why, so they can focus 
                    on taking care of and enjoying their new family member.</p>
            </div>
        <!-- end of understanding caregivers -->

        <!-- data driven design -->
        <h3>Data Driven Design</h3>
            <div class="body-text">
                <p>Now, with an area of focus, I led our team in conducting a competitive analysis. After scouring 
                    the app store for different baby tracking applications, we came up with a list of six apps 
                    currently on the market.</p>
                    
                <img class="large" src="Media/BabySteps/competitiveAnalysis.svg" 
                    alt="Competitive analysis of baby health tracking apps. Compares Baby Tracker-Newborn Log, 
                    Huckleberry: Baby and Child, CuboAI, Baby Connect, Baby Tracker-Feeding, Sleep, and Baby 
                    Tracker by Nara. While each app supports having multiple kids and across device sync, they 
                    lack parent resources and single handed use.">

                <p>I found that Baby Tracker - Newborn log had all the features we wanted to implement and 
                    thought were important in our initial research. We had found our main competitor to test our 
                    app against.</p>
              
                <p>However, just implementing those features would not set us apart in the baby health tracking 
                    market. To find out what would distinguish us from our competitors, we set out to gather 
                    information from our population of interest: parents and caregivers.</p>
              
                <p>With my team, I created a Google Form to send out to different caregivers in our community. 
                    With only a few responses in, I started to notice a trend among our participants:</p>

                <img src="Media/BabySteps/supportData.svg" 
                    alt="100% of caregivers in our survey of 7, said they needed more support caring for
                    their newborn."><br>
                
                <img src="Media/BabySteps/feelingData.svg"
                    alt="parents were overwhelmed, tired, and unprepared. While they needed mental health support,
                    financial aid, postpartum care, advice, and a direct contact for support.">
                
                <p>With this information, I posed to my team that we should include parent resources in our app. 
                    This would give parents a single app where they can track baby health, while also monitoring 
                    their own needs. Thus, saving them the extra work of looking for resources themselves.</p>
                
                <p>As a team, we looked back at our list of competitors and noticed that none of them provided 
                    parent resources. We had found our secret sauce.</p>
                
                <p>This also allowed us to update our problem statement:</p>
                  
                <p class="problem-statement">Caregivers need a centralized and consolidated resource to help them 
                    maintain their baby’s health and their own wellbeing.</q>

        <h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
         <div class="body-text">
            <p>With our problem statement in mind, I could start designing our app. As a brainstorming 
                activity I did “crazy 8s” where I tried to brainstorm 8 different iterations of the home 
                screen in 8 minutes. Going into this process, I knew I wanted a useful initial view to 
                reduce navigation time and unnecessary clicks.</p>
                
            <img class="large" src="Media/BabySteps/creative8.png" 
                alt="7 different home screen designs, each screen with different key points.">

            <p>I ended up only coming up with 7, but a key idea was born from this process: 
                the idea of a carousel.</p>
                  
             <p>With a carousel, navigating the app is easy and also allows for one handed access.
                This is important as they should be able to use the app while holding and taking 
                care of their baby. It should not take them extra effort to use an app that is 
                supposed to make their life easier.</p>
                  
            <p>With team agreement, I moved on to making lo-fi mockups of the app. </p>

            <img class="large" src="Media/BabySteps/saveIteration.png" 
                alt="A small save button in the top right corner of the screen,
                gets changed into a larger save button at the bottom of the screen.">

            <p>By making the lo-fi mockups, we realized that the save button would need to be bigger. 
                Instead of having a checkmark somewhere hard to find and reach in the corner, a long 
                button at the bottom would allow for easy access. This is pictured above.</p>

            <img class="large" src="Media/BabySteps/lofiHome.png" 
                alt="a low fidelity mockup of the home screen with the feeding, sleeping, 
                diaper change, statistics, and caregiver resource slides for the carousel.">

            <p>With this completed, I translated our lo-fi mockups into hi-fi prototypes.</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <h4>Short Timeline</h4>
            <div class="body-text">
                <p>Since our project was only 10 weeks long, it was hard for us to do everything we wanted to.
                    For example, we were unable to show our prototypes to prospective users, so any design 
                    iterations made were done through our own judgements.</p>
            
                <p>We also had to overlap items on our timeline, instead of following a linear process. 
                    So before we could complete our user research completely, we had to start designing our app.</p>
            </div>
        <h4>User Research</h4>
            <div class="body-text">
                <p>Additionally, our team only managed to collect 7 survey responses and conduct 1 interview, 
                    thus creating the possibility of missing out on vital user insights.</p>

        <div class="body-text">
            <p>If this project were to continue, I would love to reach out to more prospective users 
                and get their feedback and other general insights to inform our application’s design. 
                Additionally, I would take another look at the user flows and make the app design more
                comprehensive.</p>

        <h3>Design, Design, Design</h3>
        <div class="body-text">
            <p>As part of this project, I learned about “Crazy 8s” (rebranded as “Creative 8s” within my class).
                 It is a great practice to take 8 minutes, with 1 minute per design to test out different design 
                 decisions. Since it was my first time using this type of brainstorm, I had trouble moving from 
                 design to design in a single minute. But the time constraint helped me keep my head out of the 
                 weeds, instead allowing me to focus on rapid ideation, with the principle that there are 
                 “no bad ideas.”</p>
                
            <p>It was also a great way to see each of my teammates ideas for possible design solutions. 
                It was interesting to see how everyone can come up with different solutions and what 
                problems they choose to focus on in their solution.</p>

            <p>Overall, it is a great way to bring together an amalgamation of the best ideas born 
                from our diverse perspectives.</p>
